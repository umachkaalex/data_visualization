This script allows to plot all couple (2d plots) and triple (3d plots) combinations of columns from any dataset.

It has to be only one target column up to 20 classes (or more, but you will need to enlarge amount of colors in 'functions.py' file by yourself). This column can be or string or float/interger. The feautures (columns) have to be only floats/integers.

- traits 4.6.0
- VTK 8.1.2
- mayavi
- matplotlib
- pandas
- PyQT5
